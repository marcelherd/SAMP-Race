# SAMP-Race

SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) is a game mode for the PC version of Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (tm).

SAMP-Race is a suite of server scripts that aim to provide players a seamless racing experience on SA-MP servers.

## Local development

Grab the barebones server structure (for Windows) [here](http://puu.sh/i8ndl/9a580e7fe9.rar). Copy the server files into your SAMP-Race repository and you should be good to go. Make sure the filterscripts and the gamemode is set in server.cfg.

To rebuild the mod simply run pawno/compile.bat.
